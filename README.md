## Introduction

For the Maven Healthcare Challenge, I will be working as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA), a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends.

As part of my role, I have been asked to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".

My task is to evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:

Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?
