## Introduction

For the Maven Healthcare Challenge, I will be working as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA), a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients, and acts as a source of information on health care issues and trends.

As part of my role, I have been asked to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its 3 main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care".

My task is to evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:

Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

## Tool Used

Power BI was used exclusively for this analysis

## Visualization

An interactive dashboard was created. To view this, click [here](https://github.com/samuelejedegba/Patient-Satisfaction-Survey/blob/main/Patient's%20Satisfaction%20Survey.pbix)

## Conclusion

### National

1. The Average Top Box Percentage dropped by 1.6% from 2014 to 2022. However, it peaked at the year 2020 with 72.3 and but dropped by 2.90% in 2022.

2. The Average response rate of the survey have also dropped constantly through the years. From 2014 to 2022, the average response rate has dropped by 7.06%.

3. Discharge information has had the most positive response over the years while care transition the lowest.


### State

1. The top 5 states with the best positive responses are South Dakota, Nebraska, Louisiana, Kansas and Minnesota. 

2. The bottom 5 performing states are Nevada, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and District of Columbia.

## Recommendations

1. Staff training as regards care transition should be priority. Responsiveness of hospital staff, Quietness of Hospital environment and Responsiveness of Hospital Staff should also be addressed. 

2. Lessons should be taken from the year 2020 as facilities generally saw high HCAHPS scores. It was a freefall from 2020 to 2022 as most of the measures recorded low scores. Investigations on why there was such a sharp drop must be conducted and corrections made.

3. The average rate of response has also declined over the years. Innovate ways to conduct the surveys should be adopted in order to encourage response.

4. Hospitals need to promote sharing more information so that states with low scores like Nevada, Maryland and New York can learn from the successes of South Dakota, Nebraska and Louisiana.
